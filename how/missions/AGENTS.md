# Missions — Agent Protocol

## Purpose

Multi-session plans for tasks too large to complete in a single agent session. Plans provide decomposition, continuity across sessions, coordination between agents, and accountability.

## Directory Structure

```
how/missions/
├── AGENTS.md                    # This file (protocol)
├── plan_{name}.md               # One file per plan
└── artifacts/                   # Mission and campaign artifacts (AARs, gap registers)
    └── AGENTS.md                # Artifacts directory guide
```

Plans with deliverables MAY use subdirectories:
```
how/missions/{plan_slug}/
├── plan_{slug}.md               # Master plan
├── deliverable_a.md
└── deliverable_b.md
```

## Mission Classes

Missions can be classified by their primary activity. The `mission_class` frontmatter field is optional but helps agents understand the mission's nature before reading the full document.

| Class | Purpose | Typical Output |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `reconnaissance` | Gather information, assess state, identify gaps | Findings report, gap register, recommendations |
| `implementation` | Build, create, modify artifacts | New files, code changes, configurations |
| `verification` | Test, validate, audit existing work | Test results, audit reports, GO/NO-GO assessments |
| `integration` | Connect systems, merge outputs, cross-validate | Integration reports, cross-system coherence checks |
| `closeout` | Final validation, AARs, knowledge graduation | AARs, completion summaries, context files |

**Selection guidance**: Most missions are `implementation`. Use `reconnaissance` for Phase 0/research missions. Use `verification` for pre-release or gate missions. Use `closeout` for final campaign missions.

## Plan File Format

**Filename**: `plan_{short_name}.md` (underscores, no hyphens)

Template: `how/templates/template_mission.md`

## Lifecycle

### Creating a plan
1. Identify a task too large for one session
2. Create `plan_{name}.md` with decomposed tasks
3. Set `status: active`
4. Log the plan creation in the current session file

### Claiming a task
1. Read the plan file
2. Find the next unclaimed task whose dependencies are met
3. Set the task `status: in_progress` and `session: {session_id}`
4. Begin work

### Completing a task
1. Finish the task
2. Set `status: completed` in the plan file
3. Record files touched in both the plan task entry and the session file
4. Check if the next task can now be claimed

### Completing a plan
1. When all tasks are `completed` (or `skipped` with justification)
2. **Append a lightweight AAR** — mandatory. Use the 5-line format from `how/templates/template_aar_lightweight.md`: Worked / Didn't / Finding / Change / Follow-up. No mission may transition to `status: completed` without this section.
3. Fill out **Completion Summary** (Deliverables, Descoped, Key Findings, Scope Changes)
4. Set plan `status: completed` and update `updated` date
5. Plan file stays in `how/missions/` as a historical record

### Git-Aware State Verification

Before updating mission status fields (`status`, task `status`):
1. Run `git pull` to ensure you have the latest state
2. If the file was modified since your last read, re-read it before writing
3. After updating status, commit promptly — status changes are coordination signals

### Abandoning a plan
1. If a plan is no longer relevant, set `status: abandoned`
2. Add a note explaining why
3. Do not delete — keep for audit trail

## Rules

- **One owner per task at a time** — only one session should have a task `in_progress`
- **Check before claiming** — read the plan file immediately before setting `in_progress` (collision prevention)
- **Dependencies are hard** — do not start a task until all its `depends on` tasks are `completed`
- **Plans are living documents** — add tasks, reorder, or skip tasks as needed during execution
- **Keep tasks session-sized** — each task should be completable in roughly one agent session

## Load/Skip Decision

**Load this directory when**:
- Creating a new mission for a task too large for a single session
- Claiming the next objective in an active mission (startup checklist step 8)
- Checking mission status to understand what work is in progress or completed
- Closing a mission — updating status, writing completion summary

**Skip when**:
- Working within a campaign mission (those live in `how/campaigns/campaign_<name>/missions/`)
- Performing routine session work not tied to a mission
- Already know the mission file path and can load it directly

**Token cost**: ~600 tokens (this AGENTS.md)
