# Skill: Workspace Bootstrap

## Overview

Creates a workspace-level CLAUDE.md at the parent directory of this aDNA vault. The workspace CLAUDE.md teaches future agents how to discover projects, create new ones by forking the aDNA template, and upgrade the workspace to L1 compute.

This skill is triggered automatically when the aDNA CLAUDE.md detects that the parent directory has no CLAUDE.md. It runs once per workspace — subsequent sessions skip it silently.

## Trigger

Automatic — aDNA CLAUDE.md workspace bootstrap detection triggers this skill when:
1. First-run detection has resolved (onboarding complete or skipped)
2. The parent directory of this vault exists and is not `$HOME`
3. The parent directory does not contain a CLAUDE.md

If all three are true, load this skill and begin at Step 1.

## Parameters

None. This skill is guided through conversation with the user.

## Requirements

### Tools/APIs
- File read/write access to the parent directory
- File copy (for optional project fork in Step 4)

### Context Files
- `what/docs/templates/workspace_claude_md.template` — workspace CLAUDE.md template

### Permissions
- Write CLAUDE.md to the parent directory
- Optionally copy this aDNA vault to a new directory for project forking

## Implementation

### Step 1: Explain and Confirm

Inform the user:

> "Your `~/lattice/` workspace doesn't have a workspace-level CLAUDE.md yet. I can create one at `<parent_path>/CLAUDE.md` — it will help future agents discover your projects, create new ones from this template, and manage L0→L1 upgrades. Shall I set it up?"

If the user declines, note the skip and proceed with normal session flow. Do not ask again in future sessions (the parent directory still won't have a CLAUDE.md, but the user has declined — record this in `who/coordination/` as a skip note so other agents don't re-trigger).

### Step 2: Detect Workspace State

Scan the parent directory:

1. **Existing projects** — list all subdirectories that contain a `CLAUDE.md` or `MANIFEST.md` file. These are aDNA projects already present in the workspace.
2. **Infrastructure repos** — check if `latlab/` exists (indicates L1). Check if `lattice-protocol/` exists.
3. **Compute tier** — if `latlab/` is present AND a JupyterHub process is running (check port 8000), tier is `L1`. Otherwise `L0`.
4. **aDNA folder name** — the basename of this vault's directory (e.g., `adna` if cloned to `~/lattice/adna/`).

Report findings to the user:
- "Found X existing project(s): ..."
- "Compute tier: L0 (no latlab detected)" or "Compute tier: L1 (latlab present)"

### Step 3: Create Workspace CLAUDE.md

Read the template from `what/docs/templates/workspace_claude_md.template`.

Resolve variables:
| Variable | Source |
|----------|--------|
| `{{created_date}}` | Today's date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `{{compute_tier}}` | From Step 2 detection (L0 or L1) |
| `{{adna_folder}}` | Basename of this vault's directory |

Write the resolved template to `<parent_directory>/CLAUDE.md`.

Confirm to the user: "Created workspace CLAUDE.md at `<path>`."

### Step 4: Offer Project Creation (Optional)

Ask the user: "Would you like to create your first project from this template now?"

If yes, load and execute `how/skills/skill_project_fork.md`. Pass the workspace root and aDNA folder name as parameters. The fork skill handles:
- Collecting project name and description
- Copying the template and stripping `.git/` and `.obsidian/`
- Removing `role: template` from the forked MANIFEST.md
- Setting up first-run markers so onboarding triggers in the new project
- Offering to run onboarding immediately or defer

If the user declines project creation, skip to Step 5.

### Step 5: Summary and Next Steps

Report to the user:

- **Created**: Workspace CLAUDE.md at `<parent_path>/CLAUDE.md`
- **Projects found**: List any existing projects discovered in Step 2
- **New project**: Name and path (if created in Step 4)
- **Compute tier**: L0 or L1

Suggest next steps:
- "To create a new project later, open Claude Code from `<parent_path>/` and say 'create a new project'."
- "To upgrade to L1 compute, read `<adna_folder>/how/skills/skill_l1_upgrade.md`."
- "To work inside a project, open that project's directory directly."

## Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Workspace CLAUDE.md | File | Created at parent directory |
| Forked project (optional) | Directory | New aDNA project ready for onboarding |

## Error Handling

- **Parent directory not writable**: Warn the user and suggest creating the CLAUDE.md manually. Do not fail the session.
- **Template file missing**: Log error, suggest the user pull latest aDNA updates (`git pull` inside the adna directory).
- **aDNA folder name contains spaces**: Use the folder name as-is in the template but warn that spaces may cause issues with some tools.
