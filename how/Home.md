# Agentic-DNA

*A standalone knowledge architecture for building personal lattices and knowledge graphs with AI agents.*

> An AI-native knowledge vault built on the **aDNA paradigm** — where humans browse in Obsidian and agents operate via Claude Code.

---

## Operational State

> [!info] Current Phase
> **Phase 0 — Setup.** Vault initialized from the aDNA-Obsidian starter kit. Customize `CLAUDE.md`, `MANIFEST.md`, and `STATE.md` with your project identity, then begin your first campaign.
>
> [[STATE|Operational State]] | [[MANIFEST|Project Overview]] | [[CLAUDE|Agent Context]]

> [!tip] First Time Here?
> Click the button below to start an agent session — **Berthier** will guide you through setting up your project interactively.
>
> ```meta-bind-button
> label: Launch Claude Code
> icon: terminal
> id: launch-claude
> style: primary
> action:
>   type: command
>   command: termy:claude-code
> ```
>
> ```meta-bind-button
> label: Open Web Browser
> icon: globe
> id: open-browser
> style: primary
> action:
>   type: command
>   command: webviewer:open
> ```
>
> Don't see a terminal? Termy downloads a small binary on first launch (requires internet).
> Prefer doing it yourself? Edit [[CLAUDE]], [[MANIFEST]], and [[STATE]] with your project details.
