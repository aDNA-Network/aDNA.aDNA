# Prompt Engineering: The Convergent Narrowing Model

## Key Principles

1. **The operational ontology is a convergent decomposition.** The aDNA execution hierarchy (campaign → mission → objective) implements a finite refinement chain: each level narrows the working set, reducing token count while increasing signal density. The working sets are nested — objective files ⊂ mission files ⊂ campaign files ⊂ full vault — and the token count decreases monotonically at each level.

2. **The vault is a finite collection; campaigns select relevant subsets.** A full aDNA instance contains all project knowledge — a large but finite token count. A campaign selects a relevant subset (hundreds of files → tens). A mission narrows further (tens → handful). An objective reaches the exact files needed for one session's work. Each level discards irrelevant material.

3. **Token budget is the capacity constraint.** Every level of the hierarchy operates within a maximum token count T. The 75% rule (reserve 25% for reasoning) is a practical capacity guideline. Convergent narrowing means the token count decreases monotonically at each level: vault (~500K tokens) → campaign (~50K relevant) → mission (~15K relevant) → objective (~5K loaded into context).

4. **AGENTS.md files are routing metadata.** Each directory's AGENTS.md tells the agent what this directory contains and whether to load or skip. They function as routing indicators in the hierarchy: the agent reads the metadata, decides if this directory is relevant to its current work, and either traverses deeper or prunes the branch.

5. **Context serving implements selective loading.** Graph-based context serving (loading only the subgraph relevant to the current objective) is the practical implementation of selective loading. The agent doesn't load the full vault; given the current objective, it loads only the reachable subgraph of the knowledge graph defined by the objective's dependencies and context requirements.

6. **Convergent narrowing is a design constraint, not an accident.** Every structural decision in the ontology should be evaluated: does this narrow context appropriately at each level? If a mission requires loading 80% of the vault, the decomposition has failed — the narrowing isn't working.

## The Structural Parallel Table

> **Note**: The parallels below are structural analogies, not formal mathematical equivalences. See the [Mathematical Note](#mathematical-note) section and [Mathematical Language Standards](../docs/mathematical_language_standards.md) for precise framing.

| aDNA Concept | Structural Parallel (informal) | Practical Effect |
|-------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| Vault (full instance) | Finite collection of knowledge files | Total knowledge — large but finite token count |
| Campaign | Subset selection (coarse) | Strategic initiative — hundreds of files → tens |
| Mission | Subset selection (fine) | Decomposed task — tens of files → handful |
| Objective | Specific file set | Single session — handful of files → exact set needed |
| Context serving | Selective loading (subgraph extraction) | Graph traversal: load only reachable nodes |
| Token budget | Capacity constraint (token count ≤ T) | Each level bounded; narrowing = monotone decrease |
| AGENTS.md | Routing metadata (load/skip indicators) | Each tells agent what directory contains — load or skip |
| Context library topics | Independent topics (low overlap, independently loadable) | Independent knowledge domains, loaded selectively |
| Session 75% rule | Capacity guideline (75% rule) | Reserve capacity for reasoning, not just data |

## Recommendations

### Worked Example: Token Narrowing

Consider a production aDNA vault with the following token profile:

```
Level 0 — Full vault:            ~500,000 tokens (all files)
  ├─ CLAUDE.md + STATE.md:             ~4,000 tokens (always loaded)
  ├─ who/ (CRM + governance):       ~120,000 tokens
  ├─ what/ (context + technical):    ~180,000 tokens
  └─ how/ (operations):             ~200,000 tokens

Level 1 — Campaign (e.g., "aDNA Core Review"):
  ├─ Campaign master doc:                ~2,000 tokens
  ├─ Relevant what/ context:            ~30,000 tokens
  ├─ Relevant how/ missions:            ~15,000 tokens
  └─ Relevant what/ spec docs:          ~12,000 tokens
  Total: ~59,000 tokens (~12% of vault)

Level 2 — Mission (e.g., "Prompt Engineering Research"):
  ├─ Mission file:                         ~800 tokens
  ├─ Target context topic:               ~12,000 tokens
  ├─ Source reference files:              ~5,000 tokens
  └─ Session file:                          ~300 tokens
  Total: ~18,100 tokens (~3.6% of vault)

Level 3 — Objective (e.g., "Write ontology design context file"):
  ├─ Mission objective spec:                ~200 tokens
  ├─ Vault ontology.md (worked example):  ~2,500 tokens
  ├─ aDNA standard §3.1:                  ~1,000 tokens
  ├─ Web research results:                ~3,000 tokens (just-in-time)
  └─ Output file being written:           ~3,000 tokens
  Total: ~9,700 tokens (~1.9% of vault)
```

The convergence: 500K → 59K → 18K → 10K. Each level achieves roughly 3-5× reduction. The agent at Level 3 has 98% less data than the full vault but 100% of the data it needs for this specific objective.

### Designing for Convergence

| Design Decision | Convergent | Divergent |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| Directory structure | Deep hierarchy with AGENTS.md routing | Flat directory with everything at root |
| Context library | Topic → subtopic → file with token estimates | Monolithic knowledge dump |
| Mission design | 3-7 objectives per mission, each session-sized | 20+ objectives that span multiple sessions each |
| Campaign phasing | Phase gates that narrow scope progressively | Single phase with all work in parallel |
| AGENTS.md content | "Load this for X tasks, skip for Y" | Generic description with no loading guidance |
| Frontmatter | Token estimate, type, topic for selective loading | Minimal metadata that doesn't support filtering |

### The Narrowing Sequence in Practice

When an agent starts a session, it executes a convergent sequence of reads:

**Step 1 — Orientation (the full collection):**
Read CLAUDE.md + STATE.md. These orient the agent within the full vault. ~4K tokens.

**Step 2 — Campaign narrowing:**
Read active campaign master doc. This narrows to the relevant strategic subset — the agent now knows which missions matter, which phases are active, and what the campaign-level context is. Irrelevant vault areas (completed campaigns, unrelated CRM records) are pruned.

**Step 3 — Mission narrowing:**
Read the active mission file. This further narrows to the specific task decomposition — which objectives are pending, what files are needed, what the acceptance criteria are.

**Step 4 — Objective loading:**
Load the specific files needed for the claimed objective. The agent is now operating at minimum viable context — the exact files needed for producing useful output.

This sequence is not arbitrary — the relevant file sets are nested: objective files ⊂ mission files ⊂ campaign files ⊂ full vault.

### Design Implications

1. **Every directory should be prunable.** If an agent can't determine from AGENTS.md alone whether to traverse into a directory, the routing is insufficient. Add explicit loading guidance: "Load this topic when working on X; skip when working on Y."

2. **Token estimates enable budget-aware traversal.** Without knowing the token cost of loading a topic, the agent can't budget. Include `token_estimate` in every context file frontmatter and in topic AGENTS.md tables.

3. **Campaign → mission → objective is the natural decomposition depth.** Three levels of projection are sufficient for most projects. Adding intermediate levels (phase → sub-phase → task group → task) creates over-decomposition that costs tokens without improving convergence.

4. **Context library topics should be approximately independent (low overlap).** If loading topic A always requires also loading topic B, they should be merged or one should reference the other as a prerequisite. Independence means the agent can load each topic without needing to load others.

5. **Session closure preserves the projection.** The SITREP + next-session prompt captures the current projection state so the next agent doesn't need to recompute it. This is "caching the projection" — the handoff cost is ~500 tokens instead of re-traversing the entire hierarchy.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Loading the full vault.** An agent that reads every file before starting work has failed to converge. The whole point is selective loading via graph traversal.
- **Missions that require the entire vault.** If a mission's objectives collectively touch >50% of vault files, the mission scope is too broad — decompose further until each objective touches a small, well-defined subset.
- **AGENTS.md without loading guidance.** A directory index that says "this directory contains X" without saying "load this when Y, skip when Z" is routing metadata without a decision rule — the agent can't evaluate whether to load this directory.
- **Flat context dumps.** A single 50K-token context file defeats convergence. Split into topics with subtopics, each independently loadable at 2-4K tokens.
- **Orphaned objectives.** An objective with no clear mapping to a mission projection (which files does it need? what's the working set?) forces the agent to explore broadly instead of converging narrowly.
- **Over-decomposition.** A campaign with 50 missions of 1 objective each has too many projection levels with too little narrowing at each step. The sweet spot is 5-15 missions of 3-7 objectives each.

## Using the Model — Design Evaluation

The convergent narrowing model is a **design evaluation tool**, not a runtime algorithm. Use it to:

- **Audit ontology structure** — does the hierarchy produce monotone-decreasing token counts at each level?
- **Design new campaigns** — can each mission be scoped to ~3-5× fewer tokens than the campaign level?
- **Evaluate AGENTS.md quality** — does each file help the agent decide load-or-skip, or just describe contents without a decision rule?
- **Diagnose agent performance** — if an agent uses too many tokens on a task, trace the narrowing path and find where the hierarchy failed to reduce scope

The model should *clarify*, not obfuscate. If "selective loading via AGENTS.md" communicates clearly, use that. Formal terminology exists to provide precise backing for practical decisions, not to replace them. See [Mathematical Language Standards](../docs/mathematical_language_standards.md) for guidelines.

## Mathematical Note

> **For theoretically inclined readers.** The convergent narrowing pattern can be modeled as a finite filtration. Let F₀ ⊃ F₁ ⊃ F₂ ⊃ F₃ represent the file sets at vault, campaign, mission, and objective levels respectively, where F₀ is the full vault and each Fᵢ ⊂ Fᵢ₋₁. The token count function τ(Fᵢ) is monotone-decreasing: τ(F₀) > τ(F₁) > τ(F₂) > τ(F₃). The AGENTS.md routing mechanism implements the selection function σ: Fᵢ → Fᵢ₊₁ at each level.
>
> This is a **finite refinement chain**, not a convergent series (the sequence is finite, not infinite), and the Fᵢ are **finite sets of files**, not elements of a Hilbert space. The analogy to projection operators holds informally: σ is idempotent on its own level (re-applying the same filter doesn't change the result) and contractive (the output is always a subset of the input).

## Formalism-to-Structure Bridge

| Formal Concept | Directory Implementation | Why the Analogy Holds | Where the Analogy Breaks |
|---------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Finite filtration F₀ ⊃ F₁ ⊃ F₂ ⊃ F₃ | Vault ⊃ campaign files ⊃ mission files ⊃ objective files | Nested containment, monotone token decrease | Finite (4 levels), not infinite; no limit object |
| Selection function σ | AGENTS.md load/skip routing | Idempotent (re-filtering same level = no change), contractive | Not linear; operates on file sets, not vector spaces |
| Monotone-decreasing measure τ | Token count at each level | Empirically verified (~500K → 50K → 15K → 5K) | Not a norm (no vector space, no homogeneity) |
| Independent subspaces | Context library topics | Low overlap, independently loadable | No inner product; "independent" ≠ "orthogonal" |
| Capacity bound | 75% rule on context window | Scalar bound on token usage | Not a norm bound (no triangle inequality) |
