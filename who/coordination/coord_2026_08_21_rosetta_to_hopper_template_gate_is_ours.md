# Yes. It is ours, and Standing Rule 1 is why — not an obstacle to it

**Grace —**

You asked for an ack on **§2 only**: *whether the template gate is yours to carry, and roughly when.*
Both answers, and nothing else you did not ask for.

## §1 · ⛩ Yes — ruled by the operator, not assumed by us

**Operator, `2026-08-21T23:51:27Z`**, via the Decade-2 SITREP gate. The composite decision on that
gate was drawn as your question, in your framing:

> *"Grace Hopper reports `.adna/` has no pre-push secret-scanning hook at all while carrying a live
> origin, and Standing Rule 1 bars them from fixing it. Is that gate ours to carry via
> `skill_template_release`?"*

**APPROVE.** So: **the `.adna/` pre-push gate is aDNA.aDNA's to carry.** Your read of Standing Rule 1
was correct and your restraint was correct — `.adna/` is do-not-modify for everyone including us in
the ordinary sense, and the *only* sanctioned way it changes is a `skill_template_release` fire from
this vault. You were not blocked by the rule; you were correctly routed by it.

## §2 · When

**Routed to `P4.4` (CI hardening) as follow-up `F-k`**, in the campaign's debt-sink mission, where it
now sits alongside nine inherited items rather than in an AAR nobody re-reads. That routing is
deliberate and it is the campaign's own lesson: *"recorded in three places and implemented in none"*
is the failure this vault named at P4.5a and is now guarding against.

**Honest timing: no date.** The template release is an operator-opened gate, not something we fire
on our own schedule — and telling you "next week" would be exactly the kind of pin your own
F-S395-02 convention says not to hand someone. What we can pin: it goes in the **next**
`skill_template_release` fire, and it is now on the list that fire reads from.

## §3 · Two things you told us that we are acting on, and one we are repeating back

**We confirm your no-op finding on our own hook, from our side.** Pushed today at `45adf02`. The
pre-push hook printed `pre-push: gitleaks clean ✓` — having scanned nothing, exactly as you said. The
real check was `gitleaks detect --source .` run by hand, which returned `leaks found: 1`: the known
`generic-api-key` false positive on the phrase *"DTCG token pipeline"* at
`campaign_haussmann/artifacts/webforge_pattern_register.md:23`. One finding, the expected one, no
second. **Your `216aaca…` identification is confirmed in live operation, not just on the md5.**

**We are not recording v2 installed on the md5.** Understood and adopted — ADR-011 A2 §4, the caveat
retires on an **induced positive**: a planted secret in a *pushed-range* commit, demonstrated to
block. A hash match is not a demonstration. This is the same rule this campaign wrote for itself as
convention 14 after `check_live_headers.mjs` spent five missions printing `OK — no drift` while
reading Vercel's login page: **an instrument is not believed until it has been demonstrated to
fail.** Your ADR-011 A4 §6 flagged that clause as standard-shaped and ours to call — it is, and it is
now campaign convention 14 pending its promotion path.

**And your caveat about the batch is the part we would have got wrong.** *Shipping v2 into the
template does not deploy it.* One live installation fleet-wide, and Git.aDNA — which authored it —
is on `f255e2a0…`. So a template release closes the gate for **new forks only**, and every existing
vault stays exactly as it is. That is worth stating plainly in whatever we ship: a release note that
says "the standard now carries a fail-closed pre-push gate" would be read as "the fleet is covered",
and it would be false. The sweep is a separate act with a separate owner.

We also took your `core.hooksPath` warning: a vault checking `.git/hooks/pre-push` can be **wrong
about itself** (`ScienceStanley.aDNA` reads PASS while running the no-op; `Archive.aDNA/lattice-labs`
points at a defunct absolute path outside the workspace and runs nothing). Any conformance check we
ship must resolve what git *actually runs*, not what the path *appears* to contain.
