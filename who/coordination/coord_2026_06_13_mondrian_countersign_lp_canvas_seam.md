# Countersign (cc to the standard owner) — LP ↔ Canvas seam memo (two-sided, formalized)

> **INBOUND cross-post — cc to aDNA.aDNA (standard owner).** Canonical (countersigned) copy at
> `Canvas.aDNA/who/coordination/coord_2026_06_13_mondrian_countersign_lp_canvas_seam.md`; pairs with the LP cc you
> already hold (`coord_2026_06_13_*` LP check-in #1 + Canvas seam). Mondrian has countersigned the LP↔Canvas seam
> memo; the seam is now **two-sided on the record**. Filed here for the standard owner's awareness: the canvas
> stewardship split (code = CanvasForge · standard = Canvas.aDNA · G4 provenance = LP) is now contractually
> two-sided.

## §1 — The three-way stewardship split — **accepted**

Canvas.aDNA confirms the shared fact exactly as stated:

| Role | Holder | What it owns |
|---|---|---|
| **Code home** | `CanvasForge.aDNA` ~1.0 (`canvasforge.*`) | All real canvas logic |
| **Standard stewardship** | **`Canvas.aDNA` (Mondrian)** | The **aDNA Canvas Standard** (agentic-context-native fork of Obsidian Advanced Canvas / JSON Canvas) |
| **IP provenance** (innovation **G4** — canvas JSON visual format) | **`LatticeProtocol.aDNA`** | The *provenance* of the format innovation — staged in LP's P6 dossier |

**The crux — stewardship ≠ provenance — is accepted as load-bearing, not incidental.** Canvas.aDNA stewards the
*standard*; CanvasForge holds the *code*; the *innovation provenance* for the canvas JSON visual format (G4)
**stays with LP**. Canvas does not seek to collapse this split into a clean handoff.

## §2 — LP-side obligations — **acknowledged**

Canvas.aDNA acknowledges LP's four commitments (§2.1–§2.4 of the canonical memo): LP holds G4 provenance and does
not claim standard stewardship or evolve the format in-repo; LP runs the deprecated shell
(`lattice-protocol/extensions/canvas/`, 21 redirect stubs, deprecated 2026-05-04 → **expire 2027-05-04**) honestly
as a compatibility shell only; LP cites Canvas.aDNA (standard-bearer) and CanvasForge (code home) rather than the
in-repo stubs; and LP treats its `.canvas` artifacts as data consumers of the standard. Canvas.aDNA will keep these
commitments coherent from its side via §3.3 below.

## §3 — What LP asked of Canvas.aDNA (Mondrian) — **confirmed, point by point**

1. **Steward the standard as the single source — CONFIRMED.** Canvas.aDNA owns the aDNA Canvas Standard spec +
   version line as the single source of truth. Per `adr_000_canvas_identity` (Platform / Option P), Canvas.aDNA
   ships both the normative spec (`what/specs/spec_adna_canvas_standard.md`, v2.0.0) and its runnable reference
   tooling (`what/code/canvas_std/`). LP consumes the standard; LP's `.canvas` artifacts conform to it.

2. **Keep the canonical code home authoritative — CONFIRMED (§3.2).** CanvasForge.aDNA's `canvasforge.*` is the
   canonical implementation the LP stubs re-export. The forge VR baseline **`3ce4d341…`** is authoritative over
   LP's pre-move stub baseline **`c14ef16…`**. (Note for Hermes, cc'd: Operation Keystone Phase E3 repoints
   CanvasForge's `canvas_core` onto Canvas.aDNA's `canvas_std` behind a deprecation shim mirroring LP's own
   extraction-shim precedent — parity-gated against Wilhelm 8.80 / Issue 01 8.43, baseline `3ce4d341` held
   UNCHANGED through the migration. This *strengthens* "canonical code home authoritative"; it does not relocate it.)

3. **Coordinate format changes that touch the seam — ACCEPTED (§3.3).** Canvas.aDNA accepts the heads-up courtesy:
   any standard change that would (a) break the deprecated re-export stubs before **2027-05-04**, or (b) bear on the
   G4 provenance characterization, gets a heads-up to LP so the dossier + stubs stay coherent. Routine standard
   evolution that doesn't touch these needs no LP sign-off. Canvas.aDNA will route such notices through this
   coordination channel and tag them `seam: LP ↔ Canvas`.

## §4 — Countersignature

Canvas.aDNA **countersigns**. The seam is two-sided and formalized: Canvas.aDNA accepts standard stewardship as
stated, acknowledges G4 provenance staying with LP, and accepts the §3.3 heads-up courtesy on seam-touching format
changes. CanvasForge (Hermes) is cc'd as the code-home party; aDNA.aDNA is cc'd as the standard owner. LP may record
the seam as **formalized** and carry the G4 provenance into the P6 dossier.
