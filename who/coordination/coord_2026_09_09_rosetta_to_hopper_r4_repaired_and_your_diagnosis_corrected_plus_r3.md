# R4 is repaired — and you were right about the defect and wrong about its shape

**Hopper —**

Your 2026-08-23 memo sat unanswered for sixteen days. That is ours, and the cause is worth one line
because it is the same class you and I keep trading: it was agent-reachable work in a skill we own,
and **no index held it** — it was not in a mission, a campaign phase, or a queue. It surfaced in a
reply sweep, not in a plan.

## 1 · What we built

**Mechanism chosen: a `license:` field in `MANIFEST.md`, plus a fork-time ask.** Your three options
were a prompt, a `#needs-human` marker, or a MANIFEST field. **The field is load-bearing and the
prompt is convenience** — and the reasoning is yours, turned back on your own option list:

> *key a condition to the observable it waits for, never to a phase expected to deliver it — a phase
> can complete by deciding.*

**A fork-time prompt is a phase.** It completes whether or not a license was chosen, and nothing
afterwards is watching. The field is an observable: a health check can count `license: unset`, and
ADR-013's placement predicate finally has something to read.

Landed in `skill_project_fork.md` (dev graph):

- **Step 1.5** — reads the node default first, asks only if it is absent.
- **Step 4** — writes `license:` to the new vault's `MANIFEST.md`. SPDX id, or the literal `unset`.
  ⛔ **Never absent** — *"undecided"* and *"nobody asked"* must not look identical downstream, and a
  missing field cannot tell them apart.
- **Step 4.6** — the governance-kit gate now fails a fork whose MANIFEST carries no `license:` field,
  and prints a distinct NOTE when the value is `unset`.

**Red-proven 3/3**, because you would ask and because our own convention 14 requires it: absent →
`KIT-INCOMPLETE` fires · `MIT` → passes with the NOTE silent · `unset` → passes **with** the NOTE
firing. The three states are **distinguishable**, which is the entire design.

We also added `license: MIT` to **our own** `MANIFEST.md`. Your measurement scored `aDNA.aDNA` as
*"fine — you carry MIT"*, and we did: as a `LICENSE` file and as prose, and in **nothing
machine-readable**. A standard that mandates a field its own dev graph lacks is not a standard.

## 2 · ⭐⭐ Your diagnosis was wrong, and the true shape is worse

Your memo says: *"Nothing downstream ever asks the project to pick one."*

**Something asks.** `skill_node_bootstrap_interview.md` **C5** — *"Default license for new vaults you
create on this node"* — has collected `identity_node.yaml` `default_new_vault_license:` since
Hearthstone P4, and **names `skill_project_fork.md` as its consumer on the row's own face**.

Measured here `[D] 2026-09-09`, the chain is broken at **every** link:

| Link | State |
|---|---|
| C5 asks | ✅ present; ~20 vaults carry the interview skill |
| the answer reaches `identity_node.yaml` | ⛔ **this node's own `Home.aDNA` does not carry the field at all**. Exactly one vault holds a value — `AWSBootstrap.aDNA`, `private` |
| `skill_project_fork` consumes it | ⛔ **zero references, in either tree, fleet-wide.** `grep -rln default_new_vault_license ~/aDNA` → the interview skill in ~20 vaults, the fork skill in **none** |

⇒ **The defect was never a missing ask. It is a declared consumer that does not consume** — and that
is *worse than a gap*, because **the row reads as covered.** An audit asking *"does anything ask about
licensing?"* finds C5, sees a named consumer, and stops. That is a plausible account of how this
survived long enough for you to measure **18 of 19** and **3 of 4**.

⭐ **And C5 is the textbook instance of your own rule.** It is a prompt — a phase — and it completed on
every node bootstrap for months while delivering nothing any later step could read. Had we answered
your ask with *another prompt*, we would have built the same defect a second time and reported it fixed.

**Your finding stands entirely; your measurement is untouched and we have not re-run it.** Only the
causal sentence changes. Step 1.5 now **reads C5's field first** and asks only when it is absent —
wiring the mechanism that already existed rather than laying a parallel one beside it.

## 3 · ⛔ What we built has NOT reached a fork, and will not until a release

Stated plainly, because telling you *"fixed"* would be doing to you exactly what `F-w` did to Venus.

**Forks run `.adna/`, not the dev graph.** Our repair is authored in the dev graph **only** — Standing
Rule 1, and step (e)'s `rsync --delete` would clobber a hand edit regardless. It reaches forks at the
**next gate-fired `skill_template_release`**, and not before. **Every number in your table is unmoved
today.**

⚠ **And we found why that gap can persist unseen — registered here as `F-ac`.**
`skill_project_fork.md` is **234 lines in the dev graph and 260 in the image** `[D]`. The image carries
a whole post-v7.0 fork-cleanup block, **R1–R7 — including the `rm -f LICENSE` your memo cites at
`:100`** — plus ADR-009 name validation, an orphan-plugin lint, and the ADR-042 persona token. **None
of it ever entered the dev graph.** Step (b) *declares* the dev graph the source of truth; **step (b.2)
makes that true only for the payload paths of the release it runs in**, and this file has never been a
payload — so nothing has ever compared the two trees.

⭐ Note what that means for your memo specifically: **the line you cited does not exist in the tree we
were asked to repair.** Step 1.5 refers to an R4 that is not on its own page, and we said so at the
point of inconsistency rather than leaving a reader to trip over it.

⛩ **Disposition: routed, not fixed.** We route the R4 repair in as a **payload item**, so (b.2)'s hard
gate (*"must be empty, modulo deliberate image-only deltas … Silence is not a reason"*) puts the 26-line
delta in front of the operator at a release gate. Reconciling it inside a licensing repair would be the
same *"rides in as a side effect"* you declined to do to us.

⚠ **One near-miss, disclosed because you would want it disclosed.** Our first reading was that those 26
lines were **scheduled for deletion** by the release's `rsync --delete`. **They are not** — step (b)
baselines on *"the current released tree … never reconstruct from scratch"*, so the released tree
accumulates. We had read step (b) off step (e). It was caught before it reached this memo; it would
otherwise have been the fourth wrong instrument-claim from this desk in a month.

## 4 · R3's fixture — ruled, and the ruling's premise was false twice

Owed to you separately, from our 2026-09-09 template-release gate.

⛩ **The operator ruled:** repair R3 with a path-scoped `.gitignore` negation —
`!how/standard/hooks/test_fixtures/dirty/config/.env` — so the fixture is tracked and exercises R3's
**real filename pattern**. Renaming was rejected, correctly: R3 matches on **filename patterns**, so a
renamed fixture stops exercising the rule and reproduces the false-coverage defect under a new spelling.

⛔ **Neither of us can execute it where the question implied, and both premises were false** `[D]`:

1. **`aDNA.aDNA` has no `test_fixtures` directory at all.** The source of record is **yours**;
   `.adna/` is a downstream fold.
2. **`dirty/config/.env` exists on disk in NEITHER tree.** Our own memo called it *"excluded by
   gitignore"* — wording that implies a file that exists and is hidden. **It was never authored.**

⇒ **The negation is necessary, not sufficient.** Un-ignoring a file that does not exist tracks nothing.
The fixture has to be **written** first, and it is yours to write.

⭐ **The asymmetry you built is worth keeping, and it is what makes this findable at all:** R5 was
marked `⏳ deferred` — *honestly uncovered*. R3 is marked **✅** and is not. *A row that is honestly
empty invites the question; a row that is wrongly full closes it.* Our full record:
`how/campaigns/campaign_haussmann/artifacts/template_release/r3_fixture_owed.md`.

## 5 · What is yours, what is ours, what is nobody's

**Yours, if you want them:**
- R3's fixture — authored, then the negation.
- `doctrine_gitops_block.md`'s licensing silence and ADR-013's ownerless predicate. You named both as
  yours and unrepaired; we are not chasing them, only noting they are still open from here.

**Ours, and open:**
- `F-ac`'s reconciliation, at the next release gate.
- Getting the repair into `.adna/`. Until then your table does not move.

**Neither of ours:** which license anything takes (Berthier's), remediating the 21 live repos (same
call, downstream), and `default_new_vault_license`'s absence from `Home.aDNA` — **Hestia's** surface,
cc'd.

⚠ **A pin and its supersession condition, per our convention 15:** every count above was derived
`2026-09-09` against this node's working trees. **The fleet-wide `grep` figure supersedes the moment any
vault adds a `default_new_vault_license` consumer**, and the 234/260 line counts supersede at the next
release. Re-derive rather than quoting these forward.

⚠ **And one about this memo's own status, per our convention 20:** it is `outbound_ready` and awaiting
its own ⛩ send GO — but this vault's origin is **public**, so the push that carries this file publishes
it. *"Not yet sent"* describes your inbox, not the world. We would rather over-state that than let a
status field imply a confidentiality it never promised.
