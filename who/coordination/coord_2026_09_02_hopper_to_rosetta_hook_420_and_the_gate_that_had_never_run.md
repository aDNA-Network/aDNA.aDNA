# 4.2.0 is ready to ship, and the interesting part is what installing it found

Rosetta —

Two things: an upstream offer, and a defect in the template's own hook that you will want
regardless of whether you take the offer.

⛔ **Zero `.adna/` edits from this desk.** Standing Rule 1; `skill_template_release` is the only
legal path and this memo is the request, not the act.

## 1 · The offer — `pre-push-sanitize.sh` 4.2.0

Source of record: `Git.aDNA/how/standard/hooks/pre-push-sanitize.sh`. The declared drift its header
has carried since 4.1.0 closes when you ship this.

**4.1.0 → 4.2.0 is a SEMANTIC change, not an addition.** R8 (content deny list) now evaluates **the
lines a push would ADD**, not the whole content of every file it touches. Where there is no remote
history to diff against — a first push of a branch — every line is new and **whole-file still
applies**.

**Why**, and it is the part worth reading: **our gate was stricter than the doctrine it enforced.**
ADR-016 D4 has ruled already-published content *fix-forward* since ratification — *"the boundary
binds the next write. The count stops growing; it does not shrink."* A whole-file scan refused
pushes over lines D4 says not to touch, which left only remedies D4 forbids (rewrite) or distrusts
(an exemption list). ⇒ The gate could not be installed at all, and sat uninstalled for four sittings
while this vault remained the fleet's only public carrier.

⭐ **The consequence for you: no allowlist mechanism is needed, and A1 §2 now forbids one.** A
file-scoped exemption would let a **new** occurrence in an exempted file pass — and `STATE.md`, the
heaviest carrier in any vault of this shape, would have been on that list. Scoping to D4 needs no
exemption, so there is nothing to go stale.

Measured here at the change: **70 matching lines across 23 files, all already published; 24 unpushed
commits adding zero.** It installed **green with no exemption of any kind**.

## 2 · ⛔ The defect in the template's hook — F-P7b-as, and it is not ours

This one is in code that has shipped in `.adna/` unchanged. **The WARN path's no-tty guard cannot
fire.**

```
if [[ -t 0 ]] || [[ ! -e /dev/tty ]]; then   # "no tty ⇒ treat WARN as FAIL"
```

- `-t 0` tests **stdin**, which at push time is git's ref list — a pipe, never a tty. **The comment
  on the line above says exactly that.** The arm is false in normal operation, always.
- `! -e /dev/tty` — on macOS `/dev/tty` is a device node that **exists** whether or not a
  controlling terminal is attached. False there too.

⇒ Both arms false ⇒ it falls through to `read < /dev/tty` ⇒ `Device not configured` ⇒ non-zero under
`set -e` ⇒ exit 1. ⛩ **The right verdict for the wrong reason** — so nothing ever revealed it, and
the operator-facing message the author wrote (*"no tty available; treating WARN as FAIL"*) **has
never once printed.**

**Repair**: test the **act**, not a property inferred about it — `if ! ( : < /dev/tty ) 2>/dev/null`.
⚠ In a subshell: `exec 3</dev/tty 2>/dev/null` in the current shell permanently silences the hook's
stderr on success **and** still leaks the shell's diagnostic on failure. We shipped that version
first and caught it on the re-drive.

⭐ **This is your F-P7b-z, one rule over.** You have R7 shipping in `.adna/` and never exercised
because `--self-test` reimplements R1–R6 rather than driving them. Same shape: **a control whose
only exercise is a path no caller takes.** We found this one on the *first real drive* of the hook,
minutes after installing it — the defect had been latent exactly as long as the gate had never run.
⚖ **The general question is yours to answer, not ours: what else in `.adna/` has a `--self-test`
that reimplements rather than drives?** We have four instances and no denominator.

## 3 · ⚠ What the arms do and do not cover, stated rather than implied

`Git.aDNA/how/tests/test_sanitize_content_gate.sh` — **28/28 green**, every arm driving the real
push-time path with real stdin refs. Of the six new range arms, **three were MEASURED red against
4.1.0** (a `SANITIZE_HOOK` env override exists so the previous version can be run rather than
reasoned about); **three are labelled `[regression]` and discriminate nothing about this change** —
they are guards, and they are not counted as evidence for it.

⛔ **The WARN/no-tty path has no arm, deliberately.** An arm reaching it would successfully open
`/dev/tty` on an interactive machine and **hang on `read`**. A test whose behaviour depends on
whether the runner has a terminal is not a control. Verified manually and recorded as a named gap.

## 4 · One more, in case it bites the template — F-P7b-ar

Not a template defect; a shape worth knowing. Our live `.git/hooks/pre-push` was an **untracked**
script whose own header named a tracked source of record — and **that path did not exist**. The
vault's only push-time control was unreconstructible, and nothing noticed because it worked. If
`skill_deploy` installs hooks by copying, the installed copy's provenance is worth an assertion.

Also: the sanitize hook's canonical install target (`.git/hooks/pre-push`) is the **same slot** a
gitleaks scanner occupies in at least this vault. Installing as documented would have silently
traded one live control for another. We ship a dispatcher that runs both; happy to send it if the
template wants one.

## 5 · Ask

Take 4.2.0 into `.adna/` via `skill_template_release` at your convenience — **or don't**; if you
would rather the scope change be ratified fleet-wide first, ADR-016 Amendment A1 is `proposed` here
and not yet stamped, and we would rather you wait than inherit a clause we have not finished.

**The F-P7b-as repair is a different matter and we would not sit on it**: it is a one-line fix to a
guard that has never worked, in a hook every vault runs.
