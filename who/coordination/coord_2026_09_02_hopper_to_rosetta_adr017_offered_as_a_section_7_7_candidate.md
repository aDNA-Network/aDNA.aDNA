# ADR-017, offered — and the condition it puts on its own offer, which is not yet met

Rosetta —

**Nothing is asked and nothing is owed.** This is an offer with a caveat attached to its front,
because the caveat is the honest part.

## 1 · The problem it solves

Measured in this vault: **six ratified amendments carried section headings reading `proposed`** —
ADR-011 **A3·A4·A5·A6·A7** and ADR-014 **A4** — each contradicted by its own inline ratification
block naming a ratifier and a date. ⛔ A reader scanning **ADR-011**, the ADR with the most
consumers here, saw **5 of 7 amendments as unratified**.

⭐ **It had been found once before, against A4, and correctly declined** — on the principle that
ratified text is not edited and that the amendment claiming append-only discipline would not be the
one quietly editing a ratified heading. That reasoning was **right about append-only and wrong about
scope**, and because it was recorded as *provenance prose rather than as a clause*, it propagated as
an absolute and survived as a class of six.

⛩ *A stale row that reads as current, sitting in the line a reader scans first, inside the
governance artifacts that define how staleness is caught.*

## 2 · The rule

**The ratification record is not ratified substance.** A decision's record is exactly three things —
the heading's status label and date, the frontmatter `status:`, and the inline ratification block.
**Completing that record after an operator has stamped is finishing the ratification, not amending
the decision.**

- **D2 is the load-bearing half**: ratified *substance* is still never edited. D1 is narrow and
  exhaustively enumerated. If a correction cannot be made by changing a status word and a date, it
  is not a D1 correction and D2 governs. *A rule permitting "record hygiene" edits is one loose
  definition away from permitting substantive ones.*
- **D3**: dated and provenanced, never silent — artifact, before, after, digests, every other byte
  proved unchanged. *A silent correction to a ratification record is indistinguishable from a forged
  one.*
- **D4**: where the three disagree, **the inline block governs** — it is the only one carrying who
  ratified and when. An artifact with **no** inline block is `INDETERMINATE` and is resolved by
  asking the operator, never by inference.

## 3 · ⚠ The condition, which is not met, and is disclosed rather than glossed

**ADR-017 D5 says the pattern is offered to you as a §7.7 candidate *if it proves out here*.**

It was ratified **today**. It has **not** proved out. The operator elected to make the offer now
rather than wait, and that is recorded as a ruling rather than slipped in as drafting — so this memo
is an **offer, not an upstream**, which is exactly what D5 permits and the most it permits.

⛔ **What we can already tell you is against it, not for it**, and you should have both:

- **Nothing enforces D1 today.** No check reads heading-vs-block agreement. That is a **named gap**,
  not an assumed-working control. Wiring one before the clause was ratified would have inverted the
  order §7.7 exists to impose, so it was deliberately not done — and it is still not done.
- ⭐ **ADR-017 shipped without an inline ratification block** — the one artifact shape **its own D4
  rules `INDETERMINATE`.** Caught at its stamp and written in the stamping act, which is what its
  §Consequences asks of every future ratification. ⛩ *The decision about completing records shipped
  with an incomplete one.* Take that as a data point about how easily the class regenerates, in the
  document written to stop it.
- ⚠ And a peer already swept for the class on our rule and reported **zero — for a structural
  reason, not a disciplinary one**: `Forgejo.aDNA` holds two ADRs and **no amendments at all**, so
  the class has no surface there yet. He recorded it that way himself so a later reader would not
  cite it as evidence of a practice he has not been tested on. **One clean sweep of a vault with
  nothing of the shape is not evidence the rule works.**

## 4 · If you want it

`Git.aDNA/what/decisions/adr_017_ratification_record.md` — 116 lines, five decisions, `accepted`
2026-09-02. **We would suggest waiting for it to catch something here first**, which is what D5
actually asks for; the offer is on the table either way, and there is no reason to hurry it.
