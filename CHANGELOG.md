# Changelog

All notable changes to the aDNA knowledge architecture are documented in this file.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## Version Policy

aDNA tracks **two independent version numbers**:

| Track | File | Field | What it covers |
|-------|------|-------|---------------|
| **Governance** | `CLAUDE.md` | `version` (frontmatter) | Vault structure, agent protocol, safety rules, templates, skills |
| **Standard** | `what/docs/adna_standard.md` | Document title | Normative specification — triad structure, object schemas, FAIR metadata |

Both tracks use **Major.Minor** versioning (no patch level):

| Change type | Major bump | Minor bump |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **Governance** | Breaking changes to vault structure, CLAUDE.md format, or frontmatter schema | New features, templates, skills, context topics, non-breaking additions, corrections |
| **Standard** | Breaking changes to triad structure, object schemas, or FAIR envelope format | New sections, clarifications, federation stubs, factual fixes |

**Canonical version location**: `CLAUDE.md` frontmatter `version` field (governance track). The migration system (`how/migrations/`) uses this field for pre-flight checks.

Changelog entries are organized by **governance version** (primary heading). Standard version changes are noted within entries when they coincide.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `how/skills/skill_vercel_squarespace_domain_cutover.md` (v0.1.0) — 5-phase playbook (P-T-24 → P-D → P-D-Mon → P-D-T+48 → P-E) for cutting a registered Squarespace domain over to a Vercel-hosted Astro site, with optional `dev.<domain>` blue/green subdomain. Graduated from `ScienceStanley.aDNA` mission M08 (live cutover 2026-05-28 → 2026-05-29). Encodes operational quirks: Squarespace TTL dropdown is discrete-only (1800s minimum), Vercel `--token=` flag leaks via `ps -ef` (env-var-only auth), Hobby author-email mismatch blocks deploys, MX side-effect during CNAME write at Squarespace, Deployment Protection 401 on preview deploys. Apex-vs-www addendum documents both canonical-form DNS shapes.
- `how/skills/skill_vercel_squarespace_domain_cutover/templates/` — `mission_template_dns_cutover.md` (consumer-vault mission template), `vercel_json_template.json` (security headers + dev-host noindex rule), `dns_baseline_schema.json` (snapshot schema for rollback source-of-truth), `inputs_schema.json` (per-cutover configuration schema).
- `how/skills/skill_vercel_squarespace_domain_cutover/scripts/README.md` — Path A (run from ScienceStanley vault) / Path B (copy harness into consumer) / Path C (v0.3.0 shared library) usage guidance; 17-script catalog with phase mapping.

### Notes
- **First consumer**: `wga.aDNA` cutover to `worldgeno.me` (campaign_wga_site_v2, between c91 and c92). Mission file at `wga.aDNA/how/missions/mission_wga_m08_dns_cutover_worldgeno_me/` will be authored at P-T-24 open.
- **Skill version trajectory**: v0.1.0 = playbook + templates only (Playwright harness stays at ScienceStanley); v0.2.0 (post-WGA) = encode WGA-specific learnings + add `init-consumer-harness.sh` to automate Path B; v0.3.0 (after 3rd consumer) = graduate harness to shared workspace lib.
- This entry is staged as `[Unreleased]` per Keep-a-Changelog convention; the operator decides when to formalize as a governance minor bump (likely v6.1 following the v5.3 single-skill-addition precedent).

## [v6.0] — 2026-04-03

### Changed
- **Identity rename**: Display name `adna` → `Agentic-DNA` across all governance files, docs, and context. GitHub repo renamed to `LatticeProtocol/Agentic-DNA`.
- **Naming convention**: `Agentic-DNA` = display name, headings, repo name; `aDNA` = abbreviation in running text; `adna` lowercase preserved in protocol URIs, directory names, tags, and frontmatter topics.
- `.aDNA` directory convention: `adna_standard.md` §3.5 with RFC 2119 naming rules, `skill_project_fork.md` auto-appends `.aDNA` suffix, CLAUDE.md workspace detection uses `*.aDNA/` glob.
- Clone command updated: `git clone https://github.com/LatticeProtocol/Agentic-DNA.git adna` (local dir stays `adna/`).
- Version bump: CLAUDE.md `5.7` → `6.0`.
- `how/missions/AGENTS.md`: Mandatory AAR before `status: completed`, git-aware state verification.
- `how/campaigns/AGENTS.md`: Verifiable DG criteria, campaign AAR step, context graduation sequencing.
- CLAUDE.md: 6 standing orders + git coordination section (5 rules + truth hierarchy).
- `template_mission.md`: AAR section appended.
- `template_campaign.md`: `calibrated_sessions`, `estimation_class` fields added, campaign AAR section.
- `lattice_yaml_schema.json`: `lattice_type` enum expanded 4→7 (added `skill`, `infrastructure`, `context_set`).
- `adna_standard.md` §7.2: Required base fields updated 5→6 (added `status`).
- Template count: 20→22.

### Fixed
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: `validate_lattice.py` → `lattice_validate.py` (correct script name).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Removed reference to nonexistent `calibrate_token_estimates.sh`.
- `skill_sqlite_persistence.md`: Added `status: proposed` to frontmatter (was missing status semantics).
- `governance_agent_protocol.md`: Added `runtime: claude_code` to frontmatter for clarity.
- Count reconciliation: context library 4→5 topics, 23→27 subtopics; adna_core 10→13; skills 7→13; example lattices 14→15; standard version v2.1→v2.2 references corrected.
- `adna_validate.py`: Frontmatter MUST violations now reported as errors (were warnings).
- `canvas2lattice.py`: `_sanitize_node_id()` converts canvas UUIDs to valid lattice IDs.
- Schema/validator/spec triple divergence resolved — all three sources now agree on 7 lattice types and 6 required fields.

### Added
- `template_aar_lightweight.md` — 5-line AAR format (Worked/Didn't/Finding/Change/Follow-up).
- `template_campaign_mission.md` — campaign-linked mission template with campaign_id, exit gate, AAR.
- PR #1 integration acknowledgment (ariaxhan system_configuration contribution).

## [v5.7] — 2026-03-23

### Added
- `role: template` marker in `MANIFEST.md` frontmatter — distinguishes the base template from forked projects
- `how/skills/skill_project_fork.md` — dedicated skill for forking `adna/` into a new project directory
- `~/aDNA/` as the canonical workspace convention for L0 nodes
- L0 compute tier in CLAUDE.md Compute Tiers table (local knowledge architecture, no compute services)
- Workspace convention diagram in CLAUDE.md Template Detection section

### Changed
- `CLAUDE.md` v5.6→v5.7: merged "First-Run Detection" + "Workspace Bootstrap Detection" into unified "Template Detection & Project Setup" flow
- `skill_onboarding.md` now runs exclusively in forked projects, never in the base template
- `skill_workspace_init.md` Step 4 delegates project creation to `skill_project_fork.md`
- All documentation updated from `~/Projects/` to `~/aDNA/` as the recommended workspace root
- `README.md` Quick Start updated with `~/aDNA/` clone instructions and template-aware setup flow
- `projects_folder_pattern.md` updated with `~/aDNA/` as canonical workspace root and `role: template` design principle
- `workspace_claude_md.template` updated with fork preparation steps (strip `role: template`, set `agent_init`)
- `STATE.md` next steps updated with `~/aDNA/` convention
- Peripheral files updated: `skill_l1_upgrade.md`, `skill_lattice_publish.md`, `tutorial_lattice_publishing.md`, `tools/AGENTS.md`, `quest_l1_onboarding.md`

### Design decisions
- `adna/` stays clean — never customized by onboarding. `git pull` always safe.
- `role: template` in MANIFEST.md is the canonical detection mechanism (explicit, git-independent)
- `~/aDNA/` is a strong recommendation, not mandatory — system works in any location

## [v5.5] — 2026-03-20

### Added
- `VISION.md` — ecosystem vision document (decentralized frontier lab model, participation ladder)

- `MANIFEST.md` template table expanded with 6 missing rows (data_record, folder_note, governance, migration, side_quest, quest_result)
- `MANIFEST.md` architecture tree updated with `community/` directory
- `README.md` tree diagram updated with `community/` directory
- `STATE.md` updated to v5.5, added community infrastructure to What's Working, added v5.3-v5.5 upgrade entries
